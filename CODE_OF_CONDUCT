# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

---

## Our Pledge
We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
**Examples of positive behavior:**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**
- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (such as addresses) without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable behavior and are expected to take fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation examples include using an official project email, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response appropriate to the circumstances. The team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions.

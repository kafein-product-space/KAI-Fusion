## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

KAI-Fusion is a tool that helps you create smart assistants. These assistants can answer questions, search for information on the internet, read documents, and complete tasks automatically. You do not need to know how to write code to use it.

Think of it like building with blocks. You pick the pieces you need, connect them together, and your assistant is ready to work. For example, you can create an assistant that searches the web for news and summarizes it for you. Or one that reads your documents and answers questions about them.

The platform shows everything visually on a canvas. You can see how your assistant works, test it by chatting with it, and make changes easily. When you are happy with your assistant, you can share it with others or add it to your website.

KAI-Fusion is designed for everyone. Whether you are a business owner who wants to automate customer support, a researcher who needs help processing documents, or simply curious about what AI can do, this tool makes it possible without any technical background.


## <a name="before-installation"></a>Before Installation

Before installing KAI-Fusion, make sure you have the following ready:

*   **Docker**: KAI-Fusion runs inside containers. You need Docker installed on your computer.
*   **Git**: Required to download the project files.
*   **Environment Files**: You will need to set up configuration files (`.env`) for the backend and frontend.
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL is required. You can run it inside Docker or use an existing database.

## <a name="hardware-requirements"></a>Hardware Requirements

To ensure smooth operation, particularly when orchestrating multiple concurrent AI agents, we recommend the following hardware specifications:

### Minimum Specifications
*   **CPU**: 2 vCPUs
*   **RAM**: 4 GB
*   **Storage**: 10 GB free disk space (SSD recommended)

### Recommended Specifications (Production)
*   **CPU**: 4+ vCPUs
*   **RAM**: 8 GB+ (16 GB for heavy vector store usage)
*   **Storage**: 20 GB+ NVMe SSD

---

## <a name="network-requirements"></a>Network Requirements

KAI-Fusion runs on a microservices architecture. Ensure the following network configurations are set:

### Internal Ports (Docker Network)
The services communicate internally via the `kai_network` bridge network:
*   **Backend**: Internal communication on port `8000`.
*   **Frontend**: Internal communication on port `3000`.
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL default port `5432`.

### External Access Ports
These ports must be exposed or allowed through your firewall:
*   **Backend API**: Mapped to host port `${BACKEND_PORT:-23056}` (default: **23056**).
*   **Frontend UI**: Mapped to host port **23058**.
*   **Widget**: Mapped to host port **23059**.

### Outbound Connectivity
The backend requires outbound internet access to reach external AI providers and tool services:
*   `api.openai.com` (OpenAI API)
*   `api.tavily.com` (Search Tool)
*   `api.smith.langchain.com` (LangSmith Tracing)

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

### Backend Startup Issues

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'`**
*   Ensure you activated your virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate`.
*   Run `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` again to ensure all dependencies are installed.
*   Verify you are running the command from the project root.

**`Address already in use` / `Port 8000 is occupied`**
*   Another instance of the backend might be running. Check your terminal tabs.
*   Kill the process using port 8000: `lsof -i :8000` (Mac/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :8000` (Windows).

**`Failed to initialize node registry`**
*   Check the logs for specific node import errors.
*   Ensure all new nodes in `backend/app/nodes` have valid structure and imports.

### Database & Migrations

**`CREATE_DATABASE environment variable is not set to 'true'`**
*   When running `database_setup.py`, ensure your `backend/migrations/.env` file exists and contains `CREATE_DATABASE=true`.
*   Load the variables explicitly if needed: `export $(grep -v '^#' backend/migrations/.env | xargs)` (Linux/Mac) before running the script.

**`Connection refused` / `Cannot connect to Postgres`**
*   Ensure the Docker container is running: `docker ps`.
*   Check if port 5432 is correctly mapped.
*   Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches your Docker configuration (default: `postgresql://kai:kai@localhost:5432/kai`).

**`relation "..." does not exist`**
*   The tables haven't been created yet. Run `python backend/migrations/database_setup.py`.
*   Check `database_setup.log` in the `backend` directory for detailed error messages during migration.

**Syncing Columns / Schema Mismatches**
*   The setup script attempts to auto-sync columns. If you see warnings about "Type Mismatches", you may need to manually adjust your DB or Model definitions.
*   Use `--force` with `database_setup.py` to recreate tables (WARNING: Data loss) if you are in early development.

### Frontend & Connectivity

**`Proxy error` or `ETIMEDOUT` in frontend console**
*   The frontend cannot reach the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.
*   Ensure the backend is running and healthy (`http://localhost:8000/health` or `http://localhost:8000/api/health`).
*   Check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running—the proxy logs will show if requests are being attempted.

**CORS Errors (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`)**
*   Verify `backend/main.py` has the correct `allow_origins`.
*   In development, the proxy in `vite.config.ts` handles most requests, but direct calls might trigger CORS if not configured.

**Changes not reflecting**
*   Vite uses HMR (Hot Module Replacement). If the app state gets stuck, try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R).
*   For backend changes, ensure `uvicorn` is running with `--reload`.

### Logging & Debugging

*   **Backend Logs**: The backend uses enhanced logging. Check the terminal output for formatted logs.
*   **Database Setup Logs**: Check `database_setup.log` in the `backend` directory.
*   **Frontend Logs**: Check the browser console (F12) and the terminal running Vite.

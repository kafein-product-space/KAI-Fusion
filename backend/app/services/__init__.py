"""Service Layer for Agent-Flow V2.

This module contains business logic services that coordinate between
the API layer and the repository layer. Services handle business rules,
validation, complex operations, and orchestration.

Architecture:
- BaseService: Generic service with common patterns
- UserService: User management, authentication, authorization
- WorkflowService: Workflow CRUD, execution orchestration
- ExecutionService: Execution tracking and management
- CredentialService: Secure credential management

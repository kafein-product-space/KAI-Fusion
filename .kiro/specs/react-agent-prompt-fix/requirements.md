# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ReactAgent node in the KAI-Fusion workflow automation platform is failing during execution due to a prompt template mismatch. The error "Prompt missing required variables: {'tool_names', 'tools', 'agent_scratchpad'}" indicates that the custom prompt template is not compatible with LangChain's `create_react_agent` function requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the KAI-Fusion platform, I want the ReactAgent node to execute successfully without prompt template errors, so that I can create functional AI agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ReactAgent node is executed THEN the system SHALL NOT throw "Prompt missing required variables" errors
2. WHEN the ReactAgent uses LangChain's create_react_agent function THEN the prompt template SHALL include all required variables
3. WHEN the prompt template is created THEN it SHALL be compatible with LangChain's ReAct agent format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow creator, I want the ReactAgent to properly format tool information and memory context, so that the agent can effectively use available tools and maintain conversation history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are connected to the ReactAgent THEN the system SHALL properly format tool names and descriptions for the prompt
2. WHEN memory is connected to the ReactAgent THEN the system SHALL include memory context in the agent's prompt
3. WHEN the agent_scratchpad variable is used THEN it SHALL be properly populated for the ReAct reasoning cycle

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ReactAgent to handle different input formats gracefully, so that the system remains stable regardless of how inputs are provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN runtime inputs are provided as a string THEN the system SHALL convert them to the proper format
2. WHEN runtime inputs are provided as a dictionary THEN the system SHALL extract the input value correctly
3. WHEN inputs are missing or malformed THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ReactAgent prompt template to support both custom instructions and default behavior, so that I can customize agent behavior while maintaining compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom prompt instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into the ReAct template format
2. WHEN no custom instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL use intelligent default behavior
3. WHEN the prompt template is generated THEN it SHALL maintain the required ReAct format structure
